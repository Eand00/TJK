        <!--Rules-->
        <h1 id="title">Here are a few rules to create your own deck!</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>When building most decks, you’ll need to follow a few rules. One of the most important ones is that
                your deck must be exactly 60 cards; it can’t be any more or less, even 59 or 61 cards!</p>

            <p>Also, except for Basic Energy, you can only have 4 cards with the same name in your deck. This means
                you can have only 4 cards called “Pignite” in your deck, even if they all have different attacks.
                Finally, your deck must have at least one Basic Pokémon in it.</p>
            
            <p>The following card types have different names from their regular version, so, for example, Miraidon ex
                and Miraidon have different names and you can have up to 4 of each in you deck:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Pokémon-EX</li>
                <li>Pokémon-GX</li>
                <li>Pokémon ex</li>
                <li>Pokémon gx</li>
                <li>BREAK Evolution</li>
                <li>Mega Evolution</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your deck can include only one ACE SPEC card and one Radiant Pokémon.
                It can include different Prism Star cards but only one for each name instead of four.</p>
            
            <p>Radiant Pokémon cards also have different names form their regular version, and you can have, for
                example, one Radiant Greninja and four regular Greninja.</p>

            <p>All four “pieces” of a Pokémon V-UNION have the same name (for example, “Mewtwo V-UNION”). Therefore,
                you can only have four total cards named Mewtwo V-UNION in your deck, not four of each individual
                piece. All four copies of a Pokémon V-UNION in your deck must be part of the same set and illustrated
                by the same artist. Furthermore, they don't count as regular Pokémon, so you will need at least
                another card in your deck that is a basic Pokémon.</p>

            <p>Restored Pokémon are also not basic Pokémon and therefore can't fulfill that role.</p>
