    <!--Rules-->
   <p>When building most decks, you’ll need to follow a few rules. One of the most important rules is that your deck must be exactly 60 cards; it can’t be
    any more or less, even 59 or 61 cards!
    Also, except for Basic Energy, you can only have 4 cards with the same name in your deck. This means you can have only 4 cards called “Pignite”
    in your deck, even if they all have different attacks. Finally, your deck must have at least one Basic Pokémon in it.
    
        only one ace spec card and one radiant
        miradon and miradon ex have different names
        v union cards have the same name so you can only have a copy of the four quadrants, they have to be in the same set and have the same artist
        v union aren't normal pokemon so they can't be used as the only basic pokemon
        only one prism star card per name
        team plasma cards have the same name as the regular version
        restored pokemon are not basic pokemon
        </p>
